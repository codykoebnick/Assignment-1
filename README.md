MPP E-1180: Introduction to Collaborative Social Science Data Analysis

Pair Assignment 1 - 2 October 2015

Cody Koebnick and Rafael Palomino


For this assignment, we have explored the basic functions of R and Git to get familiar with the software.

We have created a new repository with two different R source code files. In each of these, we ran descriptive statistics on two different datasets contained within the R software.

We have also dynamically linked to each other our two separate R files.

Finally, we have made pull requests within our own repository in order to make edits and merge branches.
